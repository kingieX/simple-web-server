                Language: The language of choice used in the development of the server is C. <br>
                Why C language?<br>
                We made used of C language because it provides low-level control over the networking stack and system resources. </p>
                <span id="more-1">Libraries: The libraries used in the development of the server are: <br>
                1. libevent: A high-performance event-driven networking library that provides a simple and efficient interface for managing network sockets and events. <br>
                2. libuv: A cross-platform asynchronous I/O library that provides a high-level abstraction for managing networking and file I/O operations. <br>
                with libevent being more suitable for Unix-based systems due to its high-performance event-driven networking library.
